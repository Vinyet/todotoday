ToDo ToDay is a 3-column based planner for your daily chores. 

Left column: To Do
Middle column: Doing
Right column: Done

Each column (div) contains a label with its title, and a ul with 6 li elements with input text fields. These li elements can be dragged and dropped in the different columns. The li elements can also be sorted vertically.

The web app also included a clock in the upper right corner.

ToDo ToDay uses JavaScript and jQuery.
